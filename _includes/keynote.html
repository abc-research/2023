                    <h3>Michael Beigl</h3>
                    <p>Karlsruhe Institute of Technology</p>
                    <h4>Computers closer to your body: sensing, machine learning and innovative applications in earables and wearables</h4>
                    <p>This keynote addresses the integration of sensing and machine learning in wearable computing, with a focus on the OpenEarable project. It will show how these wearable devices use advanced sensors and machine learning for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) - interpreting the user's actions and environment. The talk will present tools for implementing machine learning on small embedded systems, focusing on our EdgeML project. It will also present novel applications in health monitoring, where earables collect biometric data with precision, and explore a novel method for human-computer interaction.</p>
