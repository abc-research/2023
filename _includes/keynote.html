                    <h4>Automatic Anthropologic Activity and Affect Assessment: About Advancing an Art</h4>
                    <p> Machines recognising our activity and affect bear great potential from improved human-computer interaction to multimedia retrieval, health monitoring, and many more. Here, starting with the history of Affective Computing in particular, we shall move to the state-of-the-art in technical modelling. This will be supported by results and findings from recent competitive research challenges in the field. From this, current challenges such as dealing with less visited affective states, affect regulation, cultural and interpersonal differences, among others, will be distilled. Finally, we shall elaborate on future scenarios of Affective Computing considering going Big Data, ground truth modelling, and prognosis. Will computers soon know our activity and affect better than we do? </p>

                    <p>Björn W. Schuller received his diploma, doctoral degree, habilitation, and Adjunct Teaching Professor in Machine Intelligence and Signal Processing all in EE/IT from TUM in Munich/Germany. He is Full Professor of Artificial Intelligence and the Head of GLAM  - the Group on Language, Audio, & Music - at Imperial College London/UK, Full Professor and Chair of Embedded Intelligence for Health Care and Wellbeing at the University of Augsburg/Germany, co-founding CEO and current CSO of audEERING – an Audio Intelligence company based near Munich and in Berlin/Germany, and permanent Visiting Professor at HIT/China amongst other Professorships and Affiliations. Previous stays include Full Professor at the University of Passau/Germany, Key Researcher at Joanneum Research in Graz/Austria, and the CNRS-LIMSI in Orsay/France. He is a Fellow of the IEEE and Golden Core Awardee of the IEEE Computer Society, Fellow of the BCS, Fellow of the ISCA, Fellow and President-Emeritus of the AAAC, and Senior Member of the ACM. He (co-)authored 1,000+ publications (40k+ citations, h-index=100+), is Field Chief Editor of Frontiers in Digital Health and was Editor in Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing amongst manifold further commitments and service to the community. His 40+ awards include having been honoured as one of 40 extraordinary scientists under the age of 40 by the WEF in 2015. First-in-the-field of Affective Computing and Sentiment analysis challenges such as AVEC, ComParE, or MuSe have been initiated and by now organised overall more than 30 times by him. He is an ERC Starting and DFG Reinhart-Koselleck Grantee, and consultant of companies such as Barclays, GN, Huawei, Informetis, or Samsung.</p>

                    <h4>Wear-to-compute? Challenges of Wearable Computing for Health</h4>
                    <p> Wearable devices are becoming pervasive in our lives, from smart watches measuring our heart rate to wearables for the ear accompanying us in every virtual meeting. These devices are becoming, in theory, very good proxies for human behaviour. Yet, making the inference from the raw sensor data to individuals’ behaviour remains difficult.  In this talk I will discuss where commercial systems have gotten to today and highlight the open challenges that these technologies still face before they can be trusted health measurement proxies. Namely, the ability to work in the wild, the sensitivity of the data versus centralisation of computation, the uncertainty of the prediction over the data. I will use examples from my group's ongoing research on on-device machine learning, “earable” sensing and uncertainty estimation for health application in collaboration with epidemiologists and clinicians. </p>
