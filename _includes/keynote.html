                    <h4>Multimodal Sentiment Analysis: Explore the No Pain, Big Gain Shortcut</h4>
                    <p>Multimodal Sentiment Analysis usually comes at massive cravings for labelled data. And, this data is best digested by deep nets well prepared by expert chefs who know their job all too well. For each modality flavour such as audio, text, video, or even physiology, a different recipe is best suited, and this is best topped by some fancy well-fitting multimodal fusion layers or techniques. This makes one wonder if there was any short-cut to perfect Multimodal Sentiment Analysis ideally saturating with little portions of data and preparable even by the domain layman. In other words: Can we solve sentiment analysis with minimal labelling effort and some black-box AI that takes it all from there, even if the data is largely heterogenous in terms of involved modalities. This talk invites to explore such an avenue with the steps of self-learning representations, coupling analysis and synthesis of sentiments for data augmentation, and autonomously learning reinforced, cross-modally, and self-supervised at scale. It will be garnished by insights into recent challenges organised by the presenter including MuSe and Interspeech ComParE. If all goes well, we shall arrive soon at instant multimodal sentiment analysis that fully satisfies.</p>

                    <h4>Reading of Reading for Actuating: Augmenting Human Learning by Experiential Supplements</h4>
                    <p>Reading is a fundamental activity for learning languages. By “reading” a reading behavior of a learner, we can know the level of the learner’s knowledge and mental states. The result of “reading” can be used to improve learners’ behavior by using various actuators, i.e., methods of giving feedback. In general, effective actuators depend on learners and thus can be found by analyzing the experience of learning. In my talk, I introduce recent results of the project called “experiential supplements,” focusing on application to language learning. By analyzing human experiences, we obtain pieces of information called experiential supplements, which make it easier to follow other learners’ successful learning experiences. As a result, learners can learn a language more efficiently and effectively.</p>
                    <h5>Björn W. Schuller</h5>
                    <p>Koichi Kise received B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in communication engineering from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 1986, 1988 and 1991, respectively. From 2000 to 2001, he was a visiting researcher at German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), Germany. He is now a professor of the Department of Computer Science and Intelligent Systems, Osaka Prefecture University, Japan. With Prof. Andreas Dengel, DFKI, he founded in 2008 the Institute of Document Analysis and Knowledge Science (IDAKS), Osaka Prefecture University, and now works as the director. He has received awards including best paper awards of three major international conferences in the field of document analysis, i.e., ICDAR (international conf. on document analysis and recognition, in 2007 and 2013), DAS (document analysis systems, in 2010) and ICFHR (international conf. on frontiers in handwriting recognition, in 2010). He was the chair of IAPR TC11 (reading systems, 2012-2016), and a member of IAPR conferences and meetings committee. He has been an Editor-in-Chief of International Journal of Document Analysis and Recognition. He also worked for international conferences including as the general chair of ICDAR2017, a track chair of the document analysis track of ICPRs (2012, 2018), and a program co-chair of ICDAR2013, 2015 and ACPR2013, 2015. His research interests are in the areas of document analysis, human behavior analysis and learning augmentation.</p>
